# MinecraftDatapacks

A link to every Minecraft datapack I've made! (or, made public)

[Village Names](https://github.com/FancyPotatOS/VillageNames)
- Assigns groups of villagers a generated town name
- This name displays on the subtitle when you approach the group
- Is one of my favourite datapacks, as having these names makes a world feel 'nice'

[Village Emblems](https://github.com/FancyPotatOS/VillageEmblems)
- Requires _*Village Names*_
- Will assign a village with an associated 'emblem' (Reskinned emerald), and give it to the discovering player
- Has a bit of setup, and has an executeable to generate a completely random emblem
  - Trust me, you can totally run it on your computer! No trojans here!
  - Source code is under the create/* folder if you're feeling brave

## Utility Datapacks

[Conflict And Dependancy Detection Datapack](https://github.com/FancyPotatOS/FancyPotatOSConflicts)
- A simple infrastructure to test for missing dependancies or conflicts amongst datapacks

[Armor Sets](https://github.com/FancyPotatOS/ArmorSets)
- Allows you to create 'armor sets', which is a single armor piece that forces other pieces to be equipped
  - For example, a space suit that is an iron chestplate, but puts iron armor and a glass helmet on you when equipped
- Features
  - Includes armor set collision, so no overlapping pieces!
  - Will automatically unequip basic armor pieces
  - Automatically includes Curse of Binding, Curse of Vanishing, and Unbreakable tags onto minor armor pieces

[Dynamic Teleporting](https://github.com/FancyPotatOS/DynamicTeleporting)
- Allows you to teleport by scoreboard values
- This probably has a significantly better performance compared to macros

## Crop Datapacks
[Custom Crops](https://github.com/FancyPotatOS/CustomCrops)
- Advanced infrastructure to create your own custom crops
- Also includes a way to 'cook' ingredients by throwing items on specific blocks
- API is currently undocumented

[Crop Starter](https://github.com/FancyPotatOS/CropStarter)
- Requires _*Custom Crops*_
- Implementation of multiple crop types to demonstrate the _*Custom Crops*_ datapack

[Vanilla Crops](https://github.com/FancyPotatOS/VanillaCropsDatapack)
- Implements almost all vanilla food items for cooking with _*Custom Crops*_ cooking API
